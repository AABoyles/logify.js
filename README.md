# Logify.js

Logify is an unobtrusive customizable JavaScript notification logging system, forked from the excellent [Alertify.js](https://github.com/alertifyjs/alertify.js)

## Why the fork?

I use Bootstrap all the time. And Bootstrap already has awesome Dialoging features. So I found myself wanting to use Alertify Logs, but not wanting to bring alertify since so much of it is devoted to the dialogs. Logify strips out all that other stuff, and just brings the excellent logs.
